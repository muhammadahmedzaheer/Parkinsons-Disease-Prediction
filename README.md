# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project involves developing predictive models to understand and predict the progression of Parkinson's disease. The models utilize various machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and provide insights into the disease progression.

## Project Structure
- `dataset`: Contains the training and validation data.
- `notebook`: Jupyter notebook with the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- `requirements`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadahmedzaheer/parkinsons-disease-progression.git
   cd parkinsons-disease-progression
