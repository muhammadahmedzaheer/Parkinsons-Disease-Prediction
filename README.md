# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project involves developing predictive models to understand and predict the progression of Parkinson's disease. The models utilize various machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and provide insights into the disease progression.

## Project Structure
- `dataset`: Contains the training and validation data.
- `notebook`: Jupyter notebook with the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- `requirements`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadahmedzaheer/Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction.git
   cd parkinsons-disease-progression

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of patient data with various features related to Parkinson's disease. The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

## Usage
1. Data Preparation:
Ensure your dataset is structured correctly and loaded into the notebook.

2. Training the Model:
Run the training and evaluation cells in the notebook to train the models and evaluate their performance.

3. Inference:
Use the trained model to perform inference on new data by running the appropriate cells in the notebook.

## Results
The models achieve high accuracy and provide valuable insights into the progression of Parkinson's disease.
